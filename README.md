# lampIR
LampIR is a project which will try to create a smart IR lamp with Arduino nano and some lines of code. The story is simple, every night when lie dow to sleep I am forgetting to switch off my lamp and I'm bored to get up too much. Also every night before I sleep I have on my hands the IR TV controller. Thus I decided to make a lamp wich can switch on/off from an unused button from my IR TV controller. 

Let's get started...
